%% Tracking Closely Spaced Targets Under Ambiguity
% This example shows how to track objects when the association of sensor
% detections to tracks is ambiguous. In this example, you use a
% single-hypothesis tracker, a multiple-hypothesis tracker, and a
% probabilistic data association tracker to compare how the trackers handle
% this ambiguity. To track, the maneuvering targets better, you estimate
% the motion of the targets by using various models.

%% Introduction
% Tracking is the process of estimating the situation based on data
% gathered by one or more sources of information. Tracking attempts to
% answer the following questions:
% 
% # How many objects are there?
% # Where are the objects located in space?
% # What is their speed and direction of motion?
% # How do the objects maneuver relative to each other?
%
%%
% Trackers rely on sensor data such as radar detections. Sensors can
% generate two detections for two targets if the sensors can resolve the
% targets spatially. If two targets are closely spaced, they can fall
% within a single sensor resolution cell and the sensor reports only one
% detection of them. To illustrate the problem, the following figure shows
% a radar with a 1.5 degrees azimuth resolution. At a range of 20 km, the
% radar sensor bin has a width of above 540 m, which means that any
% detection reported from that range is located at the center of the bin,
% with a &plusmn;270 m uncertainty around it. Any two targets within this
% bin are reported as a single detection.

%% Scenario
% To demonstrate a case where sensor reports are ambiguously assigned to
% tracks, you create a simple scenario. In this scenario, a single radar
% object, located at the origin (not shown), scans a small region about 20
% km from the radar. Initially, the radar reports about two detections per
% scan. When the detections are coming from a region around the X = 0, Y =
% -20 km position, the radar reports a single detection per scan for a
% while, followed by two radar detections reported from around Y = -19.5km
% and toward the sensor (up).
%
% The scenario and detections log is already saved in a matfile. You can
% uncomment the lines below to regenerate the scenario and the synthetic
% detections.
clc; clear; close all;

% load ATCdata.mat
scenario = helperCreateScenario;
dataLog = helperRunDetections(scenario);
plotScenarioAndDetections(dataLog);

%% 
% Looking only at the detections in this plot, it is reasonable to assume that there are two
% targets, but it is unclear whether their trajectories crossed. The
% targets did not cross as seen by their trajectory.

%% Single-Hypothesis Tracker with Constant Velocity Model
% The simplest choice of a multi-target tracker is a single-hypothesis
% tracker like the |trackerGNN|. You set it to use a score logic, to allow
% easier comparison with |trackerTOMHT| later in this example.
%
% This example is small and does not require more than 20 tracks. The
% gate should be chosen to allow tracks to be established without spurious
% tracks and was increased from the default. 
%
% The sensor bin volume can be roughly estimated using the determinant of a
% detection measurement noise. In this case, the value is about 1e9, so you
% set the volume to 1e9. The value of beta should specify how many new
% objects are expected in a unit volume. As the number of objects in this
% scenario is constant, set beta to be very small. The values for
% probability of detection and false alarm rate are taken from the
% corresponding values of the radar.
numTracks = 500; % Maximum number of tracks
gate = 45;      % Association gate
vol = 1e9;      % Sensor bin volume
beta = 1e-14;   % Rate of new targets in a unit volume
pd = 0.8;       % Probability of detection
far = 1e-6;     % False alarm rate

%%
% You use a constant velocity extended Kalman filter. The |initCVFilter|
% function modifies the filter that |initcvekf| returns to allow for a
% higher uncertainty in the velocity terms and a higher horizontal
% acceleration in the process noise. These modifications are needed to
% track the targets in this scenario, which move at a high speed and
% maneuver by turning in the horizontal plane.

tracker = trackerGNN( ...
    'FilterInitializationFcn',@initCVFilter,...
    'MaxNumTracks', numTracks, ...
    'MaxNumSensors', 1, ...
    'AssignmentThreshold',gate, ...
    'TrackLogic', 'Score', ...

%% 
% The following line runs the scenario and produces the visualization.
[trackSummary, truthSummary, trackMetrics, truthMetrics,timeGNNCV] = helperRunTracker(dataLog,tracker,false);

%%
% With the benefit of using a simulated ground truth, we can compare the
% results of the tracker with the truth, using |trackAssignmentMetrics|. 
% The results show that there are two truth objects, but three tracks were
% generated by the tracker. One of the tracks did not survive until the end
% of the scenario, that is, it was dropped, and two other tracks did.
%
% At the end of the scenario, truth object 2 was associated with track 8,
% which was created midway through the scenario after track 2 was dropped.
% Truth object 3 was assigned track 1 at the end of the scenario, but has
% two breaks. 
%
% Note that the establishment length of both truth objects was small while
% there were few false tracks, which means that the confirmation threshold
% is good.

disp(truthSummary)

%% 
% Use the |trackErrorMetrics| to analyze the quality of tracking in terms
% of position and velocity errors between the truth objects and the tracks
% associated with them. The results show that the position errors are about
% 50-60 m and the velocity errors are about 30 m/s RMS.

%% Single-Hypothesis Tracker with Interacting Multiple Models
% The combination of a single-hypothesis tracker and a constant velocity
% filter could not track the maneuvering targets. This result is evident by
% the fact that one of the tracks stops and then a new track begins, while
% there are only two targets in the scenario. It is also evident from the
% inability to follow the target turns.
% 
% One option to improve the tracker is to modify the filter to be an
% interacting multiple-model (IMM) filter, which allows you to consider two
% or more motion models for the targets. The filter switches to the correct
% model based on the likelihood of one model over the other given the
% measurements. In this example, the targets move in a constant velocity
% until they turn at a constant rate, so you define an IMM filter with
% these two models using the |initIMMFilter| function.

tracker = trackerGNN( ...
    'FilterInitializationFcn',@initIMMFilter,...
    'MaxNumTracks', numTracks, ...
    'MaxNumSensors', 1, ...
    'AssignmentThreshold',gate, ...
    'TrackLogic', 'Score', ...
    'DetectionProbability', pd, 'FalseAlarmRate', far, ...
    'Volume', vol, 'Beta', beta);
[trackSummary, truthSummary, trackMetrics, truthMetrics, timeGNNIMM] = helperRunTracker(dataLog,tracker,false);

%% 
% The addition of an IMM filter enables the tracker to identify the target
% maneuver correctly. You can observe this conclusion by looking at the
% tracks generated during the target turns and notice how well both turns
% are tracked. As a result, truth object 2 has zero breaks, which you can
% see in the plot by the continuous history of its associated track.
% 
% However, even with the interacting models, one of the tracks breaks in
% the ambiguity region. The single-hypothesis tracker gets only one
% detection with that region, and can update only one of the tracks with
% it, coasting the other track. After a few updates, the score of the
% coasted track falls below the deletion threshold and the tracker drops
% the track.
disp(trackSummary)
disp(truthSummary)

%% 
% The use of an IMM also improved the tracking accuracy, as the position
% errors reduced to 40-60 meters, while the velocity errors reduced to
% 25-30 m/s. This improvement can be attributed to the lower process
% noise values used in the IMM for each model, which allow better smoothing
% of the noisy measurements. 
disp(trackMetrics)
disp(truthMetrics)
%% Multiple-Hypothesis Tracker with Constant Velocity Model
% To resolve the problem of the broken track, use a multiple-hypothesis
% tracker (MHT), |trackerTOMHT|. In the ambiguity region, the tracker
% generates multiple hypotheses about the association of the detection with
% the tracks. In particular, it maintains one hypothesis that the first
% track is assigned this detection and another hypothesis that the second
% track is assigned the detection. By doing so, both tracks are kept alive,
% so that the tracker gets enough detections to resolve the ambiguity in
% the next updates.
%
% |trackerTOMHT| uses the same parameters as |trackerGNN|, except:
%%
% 
% * |AssignmentThreshold| allows a track to be considered unassigned even
% when there is an assigned detection. This setting allows multiple
% branches per track. However, the second element of the gate disallows new
% tracks from assigned detections, to reduce the total number of tracks and
% improve performance.
% * |MaxNumHistoryScans| is increased to 10, to delay the |NScanPruning|. 
% * |MaxNumTrackBranches| is increased to 5, to allow more branches
% (hypotheses) per track.

tracker = trackerTOMHT( ...
    'FilterInitializationFcn',@initCVFilter, ...
    'MaxNumTracks', numTracks, ...
    'MaxNumSensors', 1, ...
    'AssignmentThreshold', [0.2, 1, 1]*gate,...
    'DetectionProbability', pd, 'FalseAlarmRate', far, ...
    'Volume', vol, 'Beta', beta, ...
    'MaxNumHistoryScans', 10,...
    'MaxNumTrackBranches', 5,...
    'NScanPruning', 'Hypothesis', ...
    'OutputRepresentation', 'Tracks');

[trackSummary, truthSummary, trackMetrics, truthMetrics, timeTOMHTCV] = helperRunTracker(dataLog,tracker,false);

%% 
% The results show the multiple-hypothesis tracker is capable of tracking
% the two truth objects throughout the scenario. For the ambiguity region,
% the MHT tracker formulates two hypotheses about the assignment:
% 
% # The detection is assigned to track 1. 
% # The detection is assigned to track 2.
% 
% With these hypotheses, both tracks generate branches (track hypotheses)
% that update them using the same detection. Obviously, using the same
% detection to update both tracks causes the tracks to become closer in
% their estimate, and eventually the two tracks may coalesce. However, if
% the duration of the ambiguous assignment is short, the tracker may be
% able to resolve the two tracks when there are two detections. In this
% case, you see that the two tracks cross each other, but the metrics show
% that the break count for each truth is 1, meaning that the true targets
% probably did not cross each other.

% In terms of tracking accuracy, the position and velocity errors of this
% tracker are similar to the ones from the combination of a
% single-hypothesis tracker with a constant velocity filter.

disp(truthMetrics)
%% Multiple-Hypothesis Tracker with Interacting Multiple Models
% Building on the success of using an multiple-hypothesis tracker with
% constant velocity to maintain continuous tracking, combine the tracker
% with the benefits of an IMM filter. The IMM filter may be more successful
% in preventing the track crossing as it improves the tracking when the
% targets turn. The following code configures |trackerTOMHT| with a
% |trackingIMM| filter.

tracker = trackerTOMHT( ...
    'FilterInitializationFcn',@initIMMFilter, ...
    'MaxNumTracks', numTracks, ...
    'MaxNumSensors', 1, ...

    'OutputRepresentation', 'Tracks');
[trackSummary, truthSummary, trackMetrics, truthMetrics, timeTOMHTIMM] = helperRunTracker(dataLog,tracker,false);

%% 
% The plot shows that the two tracks did not cross. This result is also
% evident in the break count of the true targets below, which shows zero
% breaks.
%
% You can also see the true path of the targets, shown in solid line.

disp(trackSummary)
disp(truthSummary)
%% 
% The tracking accuracy is similar to the combination of single-hypothesis
% tracker with IMM filter. Note that the truth accuracy and the associated
% track accuracy are the same because there was no break in the tracking
% throughout the scenario.
disp(trackMetrics)
disp(truthMetrics)
%% Joint Probabilistic Data Association Tracker with Constant Velocity Model
% Although the tracking metrics are greatly improved by using
% |trackerTOMHT| over |trackerGNN|, the computer processing time is also
% significantly increased. A Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA)
% tracker, |trackerJPDA|, will allow you to explore further trade-off
% considerations. Unlike GNN, JPDA allows a single detection to be used for
% updating multiple tracks in its vicinity. Moreover, multiple detections
% can be clustered together with several tracks and update each of those
% tracks. This resolves the issue of the broken track. However,
% JPDA does not maintain multiple hypothesis over multiple scans, which
% makes it a sub-optimal approach as opposed to MHT.
% 
% |trackerJPDA| uses the same parameters as |trackerGNN| except:
%% 
% * |ClutterDensity| is the ratio of |FalseAlarmRate| and |Volume|.
% * |NewTargetDensity| replaces |Beta|.
% * |TimeTolerance| allows for processing multiple detections from the scanning 
% radar in a single cluster.
%% 
% Additionally, set the |TrackLogic| to |Integrated| which is conceptually closer 
% to the score logic used with the previous two trackers.

tracker = trackerJPDA(...
    'FilterInitializationFcn',@initCVFilter,...
    'MaxNumTracks', numTracks, ...
    'MaxNumSensors', 1, ...

[trackSummary, truthSummary, trackMetrics, truthMetrics, timeJPDACV] = helperRunTracker(dataLog,tracker,false);

%% 
% Although, trackerJPDA does not maintain multiple hypothesis, it allows
% both tracks to remain confirmed in the ambiguity region where only one
% detection is reported per update. Both tracks can be assigned to the
% detection with different probabilities. However, the tracks cross each
% other as observed before with the other trackers. The metrics break count
% of each truth is also 1.

%% 
% The tracking accuracy is on par with what is obtained with |trackerGNN| and

disp(trackMetrics)
disp(truthMetrics)
%% Joint Probabilistic Data Association Tracker with Interacting Multiple Models
% As seen with the other two trackers, the turn before the ambiguity region
% is better addressed with interacting multiple models. |trackerJPDA| can
% also be used with |trackingIMM|, using the same |FilterInitializationFcn|
% as before.

tracker = trackerJPDA( ...

[trackSummary, truthSummary, trackMetrics, truthMetrics,timeJPDAIMM] = helperRunTracker(dataLog,tracker,true);

%% 
% The results are comparable to |trackerTOMHT|, thanks to the Interacting
% Multiple Models, the targets are more precisely tracked during the turn
% and are sufficiently separated before entering the ambiguity region. Both
% tracks 1 and 2 are assigned to a target with zero break counts.

%% Time Performance Comparison

% Another point of comparison for each tracker and filter combination is
% the runtime. The plot below shows records of the tracking loop duration.
% The results are normalized based on the runtime value of the GNN tracker

%%
% The results show that GNN and JPDA can track the targets 5 to 6 times
% faster than MHT depending on the motion model. The IMM motion model makes
% all three trackers run 3 to 4 times slower. Note that each tracker
% processing time varies differently depending on the scenario's number of
% target, density of false alarms, density of targets, etc. This example
% does not guarantee similar performance comparison in different use cases.


%% Summary
% In this example, you created a scenario in which two maneuvering targets
% are detected by a single sensor, where some of their motion is within an
% area of ambiguity. You used six combinations of trackers and filters to
% show the contribution of each to the overall tracking. You observed that
% the constant velocity filter was less accurate in tracking the targets
% during their maneuver, which required an interacting multiple-model
% filter. You also observed the ability of MHT and JPDA to handle the
% case of ambiguous association of detections to tracks, and how it can be
% used to maintain continuous tracking while a single-hypothesis tracker
% cannot do that. Finally, you noticed the trade-offs between tracking
% results and processing time when choosing a tracker. In this case JPDA
% proves to be the best option. In different scenarios, you may require the
% more complex MHT when neither GNN nor JPDA gives acceptable tracking
% results. You may as well prefer GNN if there are less ambiguity regions
% or low clutter density.
